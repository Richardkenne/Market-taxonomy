                <p class="faq-subtitle">Common questions about the three-part taxonomy framework — Markets, Business Systems, and Delivery Models.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- PART A — MARKETS -->
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2 class="faq-question">What is the Market Taxonomy?</h2>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The Market Taxonomy is a structured, three-level classification of 43 globally recognised macro markets — the same markets used by institutional investors, regulators, and major consultancies. Each market is broken down into Level 1 segments, Level 2 niches, and Level 3 specific problems.</p>
                    <p>It answers the question: <strong>where does your business operate?</strong></p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2 class="faq-question">Why do most markets have 5–6 Level 1 categories?</h2>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The number of Level 1 categories is not predefined. Across most macro markets, convergent validation by institutional authorities, market intelligence, operators, and capital allocation actors typically results in a limited set of stable categories. This recurring pattern reflects structural clarity and institutional practice, not an imposed numerical constraint.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2 class="faq-question">How does the search bar work?</h2>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The search bar operates in two modes depending on how much you type:</p>
                    <p><strong>1–2 words</strong> → standard keyword search across 43 markets, returning the closest matches with relevance ranking.</p>
                    <p><strong>3+ words</strong> → a classification panel appears showing your best matching Market, Business System, and Delivery Model simultaneously — each as a clickable chip that takes you directly to the right page.</p>
                    <p>The AI Assist (prompt bar) uses a language model to interpret free-text descriptions and auto-fill the full taxonomy flow.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- PART B — BUSINESS SYSTEMS -->
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2 class="faq-question">What is a Business System?</h2>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>A Business System is a revenue-generation mechanism — how money enters the firm. It is independent of market, technology, or era, and expressible in accounting terms.</p>
                    <p>There are exactly <strong>12 Business Systems</strong>. Any business in the world operates through one or more of them. If a proposed "business model" cannot be mapped to one of these 12, it is a market label, a technology, or a delivery form — not a business model.</p>
                    <p><a href="BUSINESS SYSTEMS TAXONOMY/business-systems-why.html" style="color:inherit;">→ Why there are exactly 12</a></p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2 class="faq-question">What are Unit Economics, and why are they inside each Business System card?</h2>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Unit Economics are the core financial metrics that determine whether a Business System is structurally viable. They are system-specific — once the monetisation mechanism is fixed, the same constraints appear across different markets, geographies, and technologies.</p>
                    <p>Each of the 12 cards includes a collapsible Unit Economics section showing: the relevant unit of measurement, key thresholds (in red), and a structural viability rule.</p>
                    <p>These benchmarks are <strong>viability constraints</strong>, not growth targets. Falling outside them requires a clear structural explanation.</p>
                    <p><a href="BUSINESS SYSTEMS TAXONOMY/unit-economics-why.html" style="color:inherit;">→ Why these numbers?</a></p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2 class="faq-question">What is the difference between a Business System and a business model?</h2>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>A Business System is the primitive — the structural mechanism through which revenue is generated. A "business model" as commonly used is often a combination of market label, delivery form, and business system conflated together.</p>
                    <p>Example: <em>"We are a SaaS company"</em> describes a Delivery Model, not a Business System. The Business System is Subscription (if recurring) or Usage-Based (if metered). SaaS is how value is delivered, not how money enters the firm.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- PART C — DELIVERY MODELS -->
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2 class="faq-question">What is a Delivery Model?</h2>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>A Delivery Model defines how value reaches the user — how the customer accesses it, how the provider operates it, and how it is consumed or experienced.</p>
                    <p>There are <strong>12 universal Delivery Models</strong>, covering digital (SaaS, API-First, On-Premise, Open-Core), physical (Direct/D2C, Retail, On-demand, Wholesale), and service (In-person, Remote, Platform/Ecosystem, Hybrid).</p>
                    <p><a href="DELIVERY MODELS TAXONOMY/delivery-models-why.html" style="color:inherit;">→ Why Delivery Models are universal and finite</a></p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2 class="faq-question">Are Business Systems and Delivery Models the same thing?</h2>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>No — they are orthogonal axes and must never be conflated.</p>
                    <p><strong>Business System</strong> = how money enters the firm (e.g. Subscription).<br>
                    <strong>Delivery Model</strong> = how value reaches the user (e.g. SaaS).</p>
                    <p>The same Business System can pair with multiple Delivery Models. A law firm (Service / Retainer) can deliver in-person or remotely — same system, different delivery. A subscription business can be delivered as SaaS, desktop software, or a physical box.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2 class="faq-question">Do Delivery Models apply to physical businesses too?</h2>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes — the 12 Delivery Models are universal. They cover a Christmas ornament manufacturer (Direct Physical / Wholesale), a construction contractor (In-person / On-site), a hair brand (Retail / D2C), a Bitcoin fund (Asset Ownership as Business System; no specific delivery model required beyond holding), and a law firm specialising in IPOs (In-person + Remote).</p>
                    <p>New technologies change implementation, not structure. E-commerce modernised Direct Physical; SaaS modernised software delivery. The categories remain stable.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- GENERAL -->
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2 class="faq-question">How do the three parts fit together?</h2>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The three parts answer three distinct questions:</p>
                    <p><strong>Part A — Market:</strong> where does your business operate? (e.g. Healthcare, Real Estate, Software)</p>
                    <p><strong>Part B — Business System:</strong> how does money enter your firm? (e.g. Subscription, Transaction Fee, Service / Retainer)</p>
                    <p><strong>Part C — Delivery Model:</strong> how does value reach your user? (e.g. SaaS, In-person, Direct Physical)</p>
                    <p>A complete business description requires all three. <em>"We are a SaaS healthcare company"</em> defines Market (Healthcare) and Delivery Model (SaaS) — but not the Business System. That description is incomplete until the revenue mechanism is specified.</p>
